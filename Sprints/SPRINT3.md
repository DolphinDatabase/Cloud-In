## Sprint 3

<p align="justify">
The objective of the sprint is to deliver an analysis of the metadata generated by the transactions (time, bandwidth used, etc) through a graph dashboard created with Power BI. For the integration of this metadata, we created a DW database and a job for automatic updating. Some corrections and error captures were also made in order to deliver an optimized tool.
